      We collected minute-by-minute data on electricity availability, electric induction stove use, and kitchen and outdoor particulate pollution in a sample of rural Indian households for one year. Using within household-month variation generated by unpredictable outages, we estimate the effects of electricity availability and electric induction stove use on kitchen PM2.5 concentration at each hour of the day. Electricity availability reduces kitchen PM2.5 by up to 50 μg/m3, which is between 10 and 20 percent of peak concentrations during cooking hours. Induction stove use instrumented by electricity availability reduces PM2.5 in kitchens by 200-450 μg/m3 during cooking hours.

  abstract: >
      We identify key drivers of digital adoption, estimate fiscal costs to provide internet subsidies to households, and calculate social dividends from digital adoption. Using cross-country panel regressions and machine learning we find that digital infrastructure coverage, internet price, and usability are the most statistically robust predictors of internet use in the short-run. Based on estimates from a model of demand for internet we find that demand is most price responsive in low-income developing countries and almost inresponsive in advanced economies. We estimate that moving low-income and emerging market economies to the level of digital adoption in emerging and advanced economies, respectively, will require annual targeted subsidies of 1.8 and 0.05 percent of GDP, respectively. To aid with subsidy targeting, we use micro-data from over 150 countries and document a digital divide on gender, socio-economic status, and demographics. Finally, we estimate the monetized benefits of internet use on education quality as well as time spent doing unpaid work and labor force participation by gender. Our calculations suggest substantial aggregate and distributional gains from digital adoption. Moving low-income and emerging market economies to the level of digital adoption in emerging and advanced economies, respectively, improves education quality substantially and increases labor-force participation equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP, largely driven by women.

- title: "Can large scale conditional cash transfers resolve the fertility-sex ratio tradeoff?"
  note: "Preliminary draft available upon request"
  abstract: >
      Currently, there are at least 15 conditional cash transfer schemes in India that aim to correct persisting gender inequalities arising out of a preference for sons in Indian families. Despite huge financial resources being pumped into these schemes, there is a lack of field-level monitoring and useful redressal mechanisms which make their impact un-clear. I evaluate a conditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme called Ladli Laxmi Yojana in Madhya Pradesh, India. I find financial incentives aimed at the girl child increased average fertility by about 0.157 children per couple and improved sex-ratio by about 0.034 points pointing to the well known fertility-sex ratio trade-off. These effects are quite opposite to a similar CCT scheme in Haryana (Anukriti 2018) suggesting context/path dependence of these policies.
