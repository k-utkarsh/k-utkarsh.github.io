- title: "Politics and public sector productivity"
  coauthors: "Shreya Chandra"
  abstract: >
      There has been a long-standing debate on the role of public sector firms in economic development. 
      We conduct an empirical investigation of the classical theoretical claim that public sector firms are often captured by political interests (Shleifer and Vishny 1994). 
      We study the case of Indian railways - one of the world's largest public sector firms. 
      Our empirical strategy combines rich election data with a novel output-based measure of productivity - namely train delays. 
      We have webscraped travel times for millions of trips across the Indian railway network. 
      Using closely contested elections as a source of plausibly random changes in political leaders across Indian constituencies, we plan to test whether (and how) politicians affect the operations of Indian railways.

  abstract: >
      Absent adequate urban planning, accelerated urbanization in developing countries can have severe consequences. 
      Lack of waste management in India has resulted in huge trash mountains in major urban areas including Delhi. 
      These overflowing landfill sites disproportionately affect the urban poor. 
      Recent policy debates in Delhi have highlighted the lack of public investment in cleaning up trash mountains. 
      But how much should the government invest in clearing up trash mountains? 
      This project aims to build a city-level willingness-to-pay measure using an urban spatial equilibrium model. 
      Using granular data from the Indian census, we aim to calibrate an urban model for Delhi and evaluate welfare improvements from counterfactual removal of three major trash mountains. 
      Monetized value of overall welfare gains will provide a measure of city-level willingness-to-pay to remove Delhi's trash mountains.
