- title: "Politics and public sector productivity"

  abstract: >
      There has been a longstanding debate on the role of public sector firms in economic development. 
      We conduct an empirical investigation of the classical theoretical claim that public sector firms are often captured by political interests (Shleifer and Vishny 1994). 
      We study the case of Indian railways - one of the world's largest public sector firms. 
      Our empirical strategy combines rich election data with a novel output-based measure of productivity - namely train delays. 
      We have webscraped travel times for millions of trips across the Indian railway network. 
      Using closely contested elections as a source of plausibly random changes in political leaders across Indian constituencies, we plan to test whether (and how) politicians affect the operations of Indian railways.
