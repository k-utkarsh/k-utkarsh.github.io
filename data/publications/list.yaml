    We study the equilibrium effects of subsidizing public services in the presence of public and private suppliers. We evaluate one of India's largest welfare schemes, Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), which subsidized childbirth at public health institutions. JSY did not improve health outcomes despite a substantial increase in take-up of institutional care. We document three equilibrium responses that explain this policy failure. First, JSY led to a mismatch in patient risk across health facilities. High-risk mothers sorted out of the highest quality care at private facilities. Second, in line with the literature, public sector quality deteriorated as a result of congestion. This resulted in lower quality care for both marginal and infra-marginal patients at public hospitals. We show, mothers with high socio-economic status adapted by sorting out of congested public facilities into more expensive private facilities. Third, despite increased competition, private hospitals increased prices without improvements in healthcare quality, further crowding out high-risk and poor mothers. These findings emphasise the need for complementary public policies in addition to JSY: capacity improvements at public facilities and targeted vouchers for poor mothers to access healthcare at private facilities.
