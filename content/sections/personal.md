**Non-academic interests**: I am a professionally trained Squash player, an avid violinist and mountaineer. I also coached the UC Berkeley Mens' Squash team in 2022-2023. 

**Website**: I borrowed this website design from Gautam Rao's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gautamrao/gautamrao.github.io). This [link](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) has useful information on how to launch a page using hugo.
